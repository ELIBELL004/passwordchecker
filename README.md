# Password Checker 

## Password Strength Checker 🔒

Password Strength Checker is a Python tool that evaluates the strength of passwords based on various security parameters such as length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It also integrates with the "Have I Been Pwned" API to check if the password has been involved in any data breaches, providing an additional layer of security awareness.

## Features

📏 Strength Evaluation: Analyzes the password's length and composition to provide a strength rating (Very Weak to Very Strong).
🔍 Data Breach Check: Utilizes the "Have I Been Pwned" API to determine if the password has been compromised in any known data breaches.
🔐 Secure: Uses SHA-1 hashing to securely query the "Have I Been Pwned" database without exposing the full password.
🛠️ Extensible: Easily extendable with more features, such as a password generator or graphical interface.
